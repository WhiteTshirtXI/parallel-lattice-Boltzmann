# parralledl-lattice-boltzman
This is some  C codefor lattice boltzman method using parallel computing system MPI, CUDA and OpenCL
Input.txt specifies the dimension of the mesh, the dimensions of the 2d decompositions of the processors using MPI.
Sample 11 2 2 
would create a 11 by 11 mesh with 2 times 2 decomposition of processors, which is 4 processors in total for calling MPI
